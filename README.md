# Linear Regression Model for Predicting Bacterial Concentration



This repository contains a Python script to predict bacterial concentration in wastewater samples using a linear regression model. The prediction is based on the colorimetric analysis of the PCTAD-dye copolymer, utilizing data from the Tecan M200 Infinite Series plate reader. The model has been trained, validated, and tested with this data to ensure accuracy and reliability.
